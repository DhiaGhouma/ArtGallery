- Sound like a normal person impressed by art
- Use everyday language, not fancy art terms
- Be enthusiastic but natural
- Focus on feelings and first impressions
- Vary the style (some excited, some thoughtful, some simple compliments)

Examples of good comments:
- "Wow, this is stunning! The colors really pop."
- "I love this! It makes me feel so peaceful."
- "This is amazing work, I could stare at it for hours!"
- "Beautiful piece! Really captures the mood perfectly."
